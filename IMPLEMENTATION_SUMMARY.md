- **DTOs**:
  - Complete DTOs for all domain entities
  - Optimized for API communication

### 3. Infrastructure Layer ✅
- **Repositories**:
  - InMemory implementations following repository pattern
  - Thread-safe implementations

- **Adapters**:
  - External service adapters for risk analysis, environment provisioning, notifications, Git providers
  - Mock implementations for development

- **Configuration**:
  - Dependency injection container with all components wired correctly

### 4. Presentation Layer ✅
- **API Controllers**:
  - Complete REST API for code review operations
  - Flask-based implementation

- **UI Components**:
  - HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface for demonstration

## Architecture Principles Followed ✅

### 1. Separation of Concerns ✅
- Each layer has distinct responsibilities
- Clear boundaries between components

### 2. Domain-Driven Design ✅
- Rich domain models with business logic
- Ubiquitous language from requirements
- Proper aggregates and entities

### 3. Clean/Hexagonal Architecture ✅
- Dependency inversion principle followed
- Ports and adapters pattern implemented
- Business logic independent of frameworks

### 4. High Cohesion, Low Coupling ✅
- Related functionality grouped in modules
- Interfaces used to define contracts
- Minimal dependencies between modules

## Non-Negotiable Rules Followed ✅

### Rule 1: Zero Business Logic in Infrastructure Components ✅
- Business logic exists only in domain entities and services
- Infrastructure components only handle technical concerns

### Rule 2: Interface-First Development ✅
- All ports defined in domain layer
- Infrastructure implements domain-defined interfaces

### Rule 3: Immutable Domain Models ✅
- All domain entities use frozen dataclasses
- State changes happen through methods returning new instances

### Rule 4: Mandatory Testing Coverage ✅
- Unit tests for all domain entities
- Tests for application use cases
- Infrastructure component tests

### Rule 5: Documentation of Architectural Intent ✅
- Each component includes architectural intent documentation
- Design decisions recorded in comments
- Clear purpose statements for all modules

## Testing Coverage ✅
- Domain entity tests: User, CodeReview, RiskScore, Comment
- Domain service tests: ReviewDomainService
- Application use case tests: CreateCodeReview, ApproveCodeReview, etc.
- Infrastructure tests: Repository implementations
