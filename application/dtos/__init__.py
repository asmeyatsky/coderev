ECRP Application Layer DTOs

This module contains all Data Transfer Objects for the Enhanced Code Review Platform.
Following the Clean Architecture principles and architectural guidelines:
- DTOs are used for data transfer between layers
- DTOs are separate from domain entities to maintain separation of concerns
- DTOs can be optimized for specific use cases or external interfaces
