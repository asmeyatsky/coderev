ECRP Application Layer Use Cases

This module contains all use case interfaces and implementations for the Enhanced Code Review Platform.
Following the Clean Architecture principles and architectural guidelines:
- Use cases orchestrate domain entities and services
- Use cases are the primary entry points for application functionality
- Use cases depend only on domain layer (entities, services, ports)
- Use cases implement application-specific business rules
