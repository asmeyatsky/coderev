ECRP Domain Services

This module contains all domain services for the Enhanced Code Review Platform.
Following the DDD principles and architectural guidelines:
- Domain services contain business logic that doesn't naturally fit in entities or value objects
- Services are stateless and focused on specific business operations
- Encapsulate complex business logic that spans multiple entities
